Create a Program that will Generate a Ramdom number (1-50).
Let the user guess the random number generated given 3 attempts 
before the program reveals to correct generated number.
User will be provided a hint by the program by prompting "higher" if the user number is less than the random number.
and "lower" if the user number is greater than the random number.
The program can be played several times (generating different random number) as long as the user wants to.
